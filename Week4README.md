Simple payroll calculator and simple MPG calculator.
Used int for whole numbers for both, and required input for each int.
Created the calculation of hrs * pay and miles / gas.
Tried returning the grossPay inside and outside the calculation, before I realized I just had to print the result of the calculation.
